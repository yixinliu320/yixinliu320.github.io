In the market-based New Public Management movement, public programs and services are the government’s product and effectiveness becomes government’s major selling point. However, this approach may marginalize the role of democratic values in governance. In the current complex society with low public trust in government, we embrace the idea of New Public Service to reiterate the importance of democratic values in program implementation, and we examine school sustainability efforts that incorporate multi-dimensional social factors. In this study, we conducted a pre-registered conjoint experiment to examine: (1) whether effectiveness or democratic values display larger explanatory power to explain citizens’ program adoption support; and (2) when citizens have low trust in government, would they increase the priority of democratic values in program evaluation? Our results (N = 1154) show that effectiveness and democratic values are equivalently compelling in predicting citizens’ policy preferences, and the effect size of democratic values is significantly increased in the low trust treatment group. Our findings challenge the prevalent view that effectiveness is centric to win public program support. Alternatively, we suggest that public managers should not only rely on performance management tools, but also employ inclusive and open values in governance.","tags":["Under Review"],"title":"How and When Democratic Values Matter: Challenging the Effectiveness Centric Framework in Program Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chengxin Xu","Yixin Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611100800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611100800,"objectID":"922c988491d72a851d600457ae41c20d","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/publication/under-review/lx1/","publishdate":"2021-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/under-review/lx1/","section":"publication","summary":"Connecting a life-threatening crisis with geographic localities is suggested to stigmatize people from that area. However, such strategy may reduce the public blame attributable to the government because the perceived foreign threat establishes a scapegoat which transfer the blame. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated whether the “Chinese Virus” label placed on COVID-19 may have triggered opposition to Chinese immigrants and reduced public blame attributed to the federal government during the pandemic. Through a survey experiment embedded with a list experiment approach, this study suggests a heterogeneous treatment effect of such label: although no treatment effect overall was detected, the “Chinese Virus” label led to a significant increase of perceived threat of Chinese immigrants among liberals but no influence on conservatives. However, the “Chinese Virus” label showed no effect on reducing the blame attributed to the federal government.","tags":["Under Review"],"title":"Does Labeling COVID-19 as “Chinese Virus” Trigger Perceived Foreign Threats and Reduce the Blame?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixin Liu","Chao Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609977600,"objectID":"f211442a4234552bf40f1be441860195","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/publication/under-review/lt/","publishdate":"2021-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/under-review/lt/","section":"publication","summary":"Is participant-governed network or network administrative organization (NAO) more effective in overcoming complex social and environmental problems? This is a classical question in collaborative governance. However, previous studies have examined collaborative outcomes at either the organization or the entire network level, which do not closely enough to observe structured interactions among network actors. Therefore, we investigate collaborative outcomes at an inter-jurisdictional area, where reflects collaborative efforts between local governments. Recently, China enacted the River Chief System (RCS), a nationwide institutional reform that requires provincial governments to establish NAOs to coordinate inter-city rivers’ management. We employ the synthetic control method using monthly (2017-2018) water quality data from 14 river monitoring sites in two neighboring cities. Our results suggest that the reform reduced the inter- jurisdictional river site’s pollution level effectively by 36%. However, its effect size is larger at the beginning and end of a year, but smaller in the middle. This evidence advances our knowledge of collaborative governance, but also raises concern about a mandated network’s overdependence on performance oversight conducted only once annually.","tags":["Under Review"],"title":"The Effectiveness of Network Administrative Organization in Governing Inter-jurisdictional Natural Resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixin Liu","Chengxin Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608076800,"objectID":"2e0e33438c4b3586b29a2c17ff3859ef","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/publication/under-review/lx2/","publishdate":"2020-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/under-review/lx2/","section":"publication","summary":"Experimental evidence suggests that citizens’ judgments of service quality often rely on prior beliefs about providers’ characteristics, such as sectoral or racial stereotypes. Such a biased judgment process prevents the public from understanding performance information accurately and choosing high-quality service providers. To address this, we studied the relation between performance information and the evaluation mode and propose that presenting information jointly (joint evaluation) rather than separately (separate evaluation) may help people avoid stereotyping and consider actual performance. We compared people’s perceived performance and preferences through the separate and joint evaluation modes (SE and JE) in three online experiments (N  3, 000), and obtained similar results in these studies: Subjects used sectoral or racial stereotypes to evaluate school performance in the SE condition, but the stereotyping decreased in the JE condition. Our findings provide an effective tool to de-stereotype performance evaluations, which also has implications for other public management research areas in reducing stereotyping behaviors.","tags":["Under Review"],"title":"De-stereotyping Public Performance Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chien-shih Huang","Yixin Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604707200,"objectID":"e35586d35673d5c1a6cab5ed9e662a76","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/publication/working-paper/hl/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper/hl/","section":"publication","summary":"That leadership turnover produces profound organizational outcomes has been documented in the public management and urban governance literature. However, empirical evidence regarding the turnover-performance relationship so far still remains elusive. To disentangle their mix associations, this study investigates the mediating and moderating role of interlocal collaboration. Theoretically, interlocal collaboration can be an appealing institutional arrangement for policy problems which single governments actions cannot fully or efficiently solve. And interlocal collaboration can potentially affect the turnover-performance in two ways. Leadership turnover may initiate the reassessment of the adoption of such institutional arrangement, so institutional restructure following turnover events would exert impacts on organizational performance. On the other hand, the interdependency between collaborative partners embedded in policy problems and past interactions could preclude unilateral termination of collaborative relations, leaving new leaders who cannot reselect partners at their will, but need to manage the existing collaboration with limited human and social capitals incapable of reversing and maintaining a trend. To test our hypotheses, we collected the data of leadership turnover, interlocal agreement in police services, and crime incidents in Nebraska from 2012 to 2018. Using system generalized method of moment model, empirical findings reject the mediation effect while causally support that the size of interlocal collaboration network moderates the positive effect of executive turnover on organizational performance.","tags":["Conference Paper"],"title":"Turnover, Interlocal Collaboration and Organizational Performance: Testing Mediator and Moderator Effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
