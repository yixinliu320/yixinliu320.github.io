To overcome endogeneity of measuring trust in traditional surveys, I proposed an alternative design that uses randomly assigned public integrity information as the instrumental variable of trust in government. The results from two online experiments indicate that citizens have strong preferences on public-citizen partnership, regardless the variations of trust in government. Moreover, trust in government has nonlinear effects on perceived public-private partnership and willingness to coproduce. These findings provide new opportunities to study public trust and offer implications to further develop collaborative governance theory.","tags":[""],"title":"Public Trust and Collaborative Governance: An Instrumental Variable Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixin Liu","Chengxin Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652659200,"objectID":"5c3be620b71045be299dc08d672eff2f","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/publication/lx2/","publishdate":"2022-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lx2/","section":"publication","summary":"Experimental evidence suggests that citizens’ judgments of service quality often rely on prior beliefs about providers’ characteristics, such as racial stereotypes. Such a biased judgment process prevents the public from understanding performance information accurately and choosing high-quality service providers. To address this, we studied the relation between performance information and the evaluation mode and propose that presenting information jointly (joint evaluation) rather than separately (separate evaluation) may help people avoid stereotyping and consider actual performance. We compared people’s perceived performance and preferences through the separate and joint evaluation modes (SE and JE) in three online experiments (N  2,000), and obtained similar results in all studies: Subjects used racial stereotype to evaluate school performance in the SE condition, but such stereotyping decreased in the JE condition. Our findings provide an effective tool to de-stereotype performance evaluations, which also has implications for other public management research areas in reducing stereotyping behaviours.","tags":[""],"title":"De-stereotyping Public Performance Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixin Liu","Chao Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641945600,"objectID":"0bafd17d5438709a4d200fdb0a7627ca","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/publication/lt/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lt/","section":"publication","summary":"Can network administrative organizations (NAOs) improve networks’ ability to solve complex social and environmental problems? This is a classical question in collaborative governance. The public management literature examines collaborative outcomes at either the organization or the entire network level, but has not addressed “edge level” outcomes to evaluate structured interactions among network actors. Therefore, we investigate outcomes in an inter-jurisdictional area that reflect collaborative efforts between local governments. Recently, Guangdong Province in China enacted the River Chief System, an institutional reform that mandates the provincial government to establish a NAO to coordinate inter-city rivers’ management. To assess how well the reform has worked to reduce pollution, we employ the synthetic control method using monthly water quality data from 14 river monitoring sites in two neighboring cities. Our results indicate that the reform reduced the inter-jurisdictional river sites’ pollution level effectively by 36% in the following year. This preliminary finding contributes to the collaborative governance theory and provides new evidence on whether the NAO model improves the shared outcomes between local governments.","tags":[""],"title":"The Effectiveness of Network Administrative Organizations in Governing Inter-jurisdictional Natural Resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chengxin Xu","Yixin Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628121600,"objectID":"e87daf2e388437f6cd25475b1246f651","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/publication/lx1/","publishdate":"2021-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lx1/","section":"publication","summary":"Associating a life-threatening crisis with a geographic locality can stigmatize people from that area. However, such a strategy may reduce the public blame attributed to the government because the perceived foreign threat establishes a scapegoat, which transfers that blame. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated whether the “Chinese Virus” label placed on COVID-19 has elicited opposition to Chinese immigrants and reduced public blame attributed to the federal government. We used a survey experiment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a list experiment to measure perceived threat. The descriptive analysis suggested a negative attitude toward Chinese immigrants overall, in which conservatives expressed stronger negative attitudes than did liberals and moderates. While labelling COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus” did not make a difference overall, our exploratory results shows that it led to a significant increase in liberals’ perception that Chinese immigrants are a threat. However, the “Chinese Virus” label showed no effect overall in reducing the extent to which either liberals or conservatives’ attributed blame to the federal government.","tags":[""],"title":"Does Mislabeling COVID-19 Elicit the Perception of Threat and Reduce Blame?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixin Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619740800,"objectID":"76aa307c968cbac8e5d6959d2cd845f5","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/working/networkexp/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working/networkexp/","section":"working","summary":"The earlier research agenda on intergovernmental collaboration is “too late” and “too aggregated.” The existing literature investigates intergovernmental collaborations in the late stage after networks have formed. Further, intergovernmental network analyses are aggregated at the organizational and network levels, which makes it difficult to discern government leaders’ individual motivations to collaborate. To help us achieve a proactive worldview, this study integrates three fundamental network formation theories, rational choice, political homophily, and social capital, to predict public officials’ decisions to collaborate. A conjoint experiment of U.S. municipal officials was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that all three theories determine municipal officials’ decisions to collaborate in sustainability programs jointly, but political homophily has relatively less explanatory power than the other two. This study revealed further the different priorities between elected officials and city managers’ choice to collaborate. An additional subgroup analysis of party affiliation suggested that Republicans are willing to sacrifice self-interests to balance costs with their co-partisan collaborators. Overall, this experimental approach advances network theories and offers new opportunities to study intergovernmental collaboration.","tags":["Under Review"],"title":"Micro Foundations of Network Formation: Experimental Evidence from American Municipal Governments","type":"working"},{"authors":["Chien-shih Huang","Yixin Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604707200,"objectID":"5b24f7acd3f9a8d7de8f03477fa08fb4","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/working/hl/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working/hl/","section":"working","summary":"That leadership turnover produces profound organizational outcomes has been documented in the public management and urban governance literature. However, empirical evidence regarding the turnover-performance relationship so far still remains elusive. To disentangle their mix associations, this study investigates the mediating and moderating role of interlocal collaboration. Theoretically, interlocal collaboration can be an appealing institutional arrangement for policy problems which single governments actions cannot fully or efficiently solve. And interlocal collaboration can potentially affect the turnover-performance in two ways. Leadership turnover may initiate the reassessment of the adoption of such institutional arrangement, so institutional restructure following turnover events would exert impacts on organizational performance. On the other hand, the interdependency between collaborative partners embedded in policy problems and past interactions could preclude unilateral termination of collaborative relations, leaving new leaders who cannot reselect partners at their will, but need to manage the existing collaboration with limited human and social capitals incapable of reversing and maintaining a trend. To test our hypotheses, we collected the data of leadership turnover, interlocal agreement in police services, and crime incidents in Nebraska from 2012 to 2018. Using system generalized method of moment model, empirical findings reject the mediation effect while causally support that the size of interlocal collaboration network moderates the positive effect of executive turnover on organizational performance.","tags":["Conference Paper"],"title":"Turnover, Interlocal Collaboration and Organizational Performance: Testing Mediator and Moderator Effects","type":"working"},{"authors":["Yixin Liu","Heewon Lee","Frances Berry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595203200,"objectID":"2141e021b85874c18f68feb38265c07e","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/working/llb/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working/llb/","section":"working","summary":"Performance information is overwhelmingly used in program evaluation by both public managers and external stakeholders. In the market-based New Public Management movement, effectiveness is public programs’ major selling point. However, this approach may marginalize the role of democratic values in governance. In the current complex society with antigovernment sentiments, we embrace the idea of New Public Service to reiterate the importance of democratic values. Using a conjoint experiment, we compare the effects of effectiveness and democratic values in predicting public program adoption support, conditioned on citizens’ trust in government. Our results show that effectiveness and democratic values contribute similar effects in explaining policy preferences; distrust in government strengthens the effect of democratic values but reduces the effect of effectiveness. Our findings challenge the prevalent effectiveness centric framework in public management. We suggest that citizen-state interaction should not rely only on performance merits, but also on inclusiveness and openness values.","tags":["Under Review"],"title":"How and When Democratic Values Matter: Challenging the Effectiveness Centric Framework in Program Evaluation","type":"working"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"http://yixin-liu.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
